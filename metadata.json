  "description": "THIS N8N TEMPLATE LETS YOU RUN PROMPTS AGAINST 350+ LLM MODELS AND SEE EXACTLYWHAT EACH REQUEST COSTS WITH REAL-TIME PRICING FROM OPENROUTERUse cases are many: Compare costs across different models, plan your AI budget,optimize prompts for cost efficiency, or track expenses for client billing!GOOD TO KNOW * OpenRouter charges a platform fee on top of model costs. See OpenRouter Pricing [https://openrouter.ai/pricing] for details. * You need an OpenRouter account with API credits. Free signup available with some free models included. * Pricing data is fetched live from OpenRouter's API, so costs are always up-to-date.HOW IT WORKS 1. All available models are fetched from OpenRouter's API when you start. 2. You select a model and enter your prompt via the form (or just use the chat). 3. The prompt is sent to OpenRouter and the response is captured. 4. Token usage (input/output) is extracted from the response using a LangChain Code node. 5. Real-time pricing for your selected model is fetched from OpenRouter. 6. The exact cost is calculated and displayed alongside your AI response.HOW TO USE * Chat interface: Quick testing - just type a prompt and get the response with costs. * Form interface: Select from all available models via dropdown, enter your prompt, and get a detailed cost breakdown. * Click \"Show Details\" on the result form to see the full breakdown (input tokens, output tokens, cost per type).REQUIREMENTS * OpenRouter account with API key (Get one here [https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys])CUSTOMISING THIS WORKFLOW * Add a database node to log all requests and costs over time * Connect to Google Sheets for cost tracking and reporting * Extend with LLM-as-Judge evaluation to also check response quality",
